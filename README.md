# Lazy-Guy
Lazy Guy is an application that allows color tracking (from a laser pointer or other colored object) to be translated as diatonic pitch events. It was developed by V.J. Manzo (http://vjmanzo.com) as part of the EAMIR project (http://eamir.org).

The source requires Max 7 or later and the EAMIR SDK package available through Max in the "Package Manager".
